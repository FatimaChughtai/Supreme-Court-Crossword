# Crossword

## About

A simple crossword that I made as a gift. Used the node library react-crossword by @jaredreisinger. The crossword has simple error checking to be able to tell whether the letter you put in is correct or not.

## How to run

To run the application, once you have download that directory. You must install all the proper packages by running the command:

#### npm install

Once all the node packages have been installed, then we are able to start the React application by running the command:

#### npm start

This will runs the app in development mode. To be able to view it on our browser or to open it , we can do it here: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
